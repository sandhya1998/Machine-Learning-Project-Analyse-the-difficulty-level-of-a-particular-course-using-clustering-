# Machine-Learning-Project-Analyse-the-difficulty-level-of-a-particular-course-using-clustering-

In this project I have analyse the difficulty level of a particular course using clustering algorithm using Bachelor Of Technology in Electrical Engineering of Lovely Professional University. Basically i have followed these steps in this project:-
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Label Encoding
3. Feature Selection
4. Normalization
5. clustering :- In clustering I have used three clustering algorithm 
           5.1. KMeans which is giving silhouette_score of approx 27
           5.2. Agglomerative Clustering which was giving silhouette_score of 20
           5.3. Clustering using BIRCH which was giving the silhouette_score of 24
           
           Text(0.5, 0, 'Clustering Methods')
KMEANS cluster has maxm score so this model is fitting the data into correct clusters, So by taking these predicted values counting the number of Easy ,Average and Difficult Courses in the DataSet.
